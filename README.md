Event Calendar with Google API

This project was created with React and Gatsby for my ITDEV-164 Project 3. For this project, I simply wanted to create an event calendar
where you could add events to it from the top of the screen, but my attention was caught by a project that had a similar idea of a 
to-do list project, but you used a google form to submit to-do objects. I wanted to implement this into the project, so I started 
researching.

Unfortunately, a majority of the project was spent researching the Google API, getting the credential system to work correctly, and then 
using GraphQL to grab the correct data. In essesnce, I created a base project with the calendar and a theme, used GraphQL to create nodes, 
where GraphQL was querying a Google Spreadsheet, where the form was submitted to. In concept, the project wasn't hard, but the initial 
dependency I was going to use was depreciated, which I was unaware of. I ended up finding one that correcly allowed me to interface with 
the Google API, which took way longer than I had expected. 

If I were to do a project like this again in the future, I wouldn't have gone as far to utilize the whole Google Form option, as so much
of the project was spent looking at other projects and documentation for some of the dependencies, I could've probably created a much
more interesting project if I had just stuck with a form at the top of the page. 

To further show the project, within the submission text section on blackboard, I linked a Google Drive video where I demoed the project and
talked about it.
